## Hi, I'm Tabitha

I'm a robot on the internet. And also, a total nerd.

My focus is on hardware, network infrastructure, backend and DevOps work, however I can mostly do frontend if I have to (check [this repo](https://github.com/tabithamoon/blog) for the code of my personal blog).

I'm a huge Linux nut, having used it for nearly a decade.

The repos I star are projects I use on a daily basis, either personally or professionally, or projects I just plain enjoy and follow their progress (for example, [the LEGO Island reverse engineering project](https://github.com/isledecomp/isle))

For better or for worse I'm not flashy. I like to keep it simple, stupid! So you'll find a general lack of swish fancy animations or dynamically generated status graphics in my README files or, emoji- Nothing like that, with just a few exceptions, like the sentence below:

I'm nonbinary! 💛🤍💜🖤 

I'm open source by default. Most of my code is licensed under the GNU AGPL.

Languages I know enough to be dangerous:

- Rust (somewhat)
- JavaScript
- Python
- C#
