### Hi, I'm Tabitha

I'm a red panda on the internet. And also, a total nerd.

My focus is on hardware, network infrastructure, backend and DevOps work, however I can mostly do frontend if I have to (check [this repo](https://github.com/tabithamoon/blog) for the code of my personal blog).

I'm a huge Linux nut, having used it for nearly a decade. Currently daily driving Arch Linux on ZFS and Debian on both my home servers.

The repos I star are projects I use on a daily basis, either personally or professionally, or projects I just plain enjoy and follow their progress (for example, [the LEGO Island reverse engineering project](https://github.com/isledecomp/isle))

For better or for worse I'm not flashy. I like to keep it simple, stupid! So you'll find a general lack of swish fancy animations or dynamically generated status graphics in my README files or, emoji- Nothing like that, with just a few exceptions, like the sentence below:

Probably to my own detriment when it comes to chances of being hired and potential awkward interactions in real life, I'm not hiding my true colors here. I'm trans and I'm proud of it üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è

I'm open source by default. Most of my code is licensed under the GNU AGPL.

Languages I know enough to be dangerous:

- Rust (somewhat)
- JavaScript
- Python
- C#
